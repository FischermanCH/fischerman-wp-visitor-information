A Wordpress plugin that displays the visitor information that can be retrieved via Java Script and "Window Object".
<br>
To display the complete data use the following shortcode : <br>
[visitor_info].<br>
There is a widget where you can select what you want to display in the widget for visitor information.
<br>
The whole code was generated using artificial intelligence and seems to work.
<br>
Installation:<br>
Place the file " fm-visitor.information.php" in a new directory in the wordpress plugin directory and activate it via GUI.
<br>
Use at your own risk, support only if artificial intelligence is involved.
It would be nice if the code would be picked up and extended by a programmer, because I am definitely not a programmer ;-)
