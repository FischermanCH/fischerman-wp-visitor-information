## Wordpress Plugin
# Visitor Information (by Fischerman.ch and Friend's)

A Wordpress plugin that displays visitor information which can be retrieved via the Java Script  **Window Object**.

To display the complete data use the following shortcode somewhere in your Wordpress pages or post's:

<strong><em>[visitor_info]</em></strong>

There is also a Wordpress widget where you can select what information you want to display in the widget.

***The whole code was generated using artificial intelligence !!!***
<br>
If you think the code is worth further developing, drop me a note !
<br>
Demo available here : [Fischerman.CH Website/Visitor Information](https://www.fischerman.ch/?page_id=530092)
<br>
### Installation:
-create a new folder in your wordpress plugin directory (normaly *wp-content/plugins*) and name it with a name of your choice.<br>
-Place the file [ fm-visitor.information.php ](https://github.com/FischermanCH/fischerman-wp-visitor-information/blob/main/fm-visitor.information.php) in this new directory.<br>
-Activate it via the GUI.

Use at your own risk, support only if I can involve an artificial intelligence ðŸ˜³
