A Wordpress plugin that displays the visitor information that can be retrieved via Java Script and "Window Object".

To display the complete data use the following shortcode :

<strong><em>[visitor_info]</em></strong>

There is a widget where you can select what you want to display in the widget for visitor information.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">The whole code was generated using artificial intelligence and seems to work.</span>

Installation:
Place the file " <em><span style="color: #3366ff;">fm-visitor.information.php</span></em>" in a new directory in the wordpress plugin directory and activate it via the GUI.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Use at your own risk</span>, support only if artificial intelligence is involved ;-)

It would be nice if this code would be picked up and extended by a real programmer, because I am definitely not a programmer ;-)
