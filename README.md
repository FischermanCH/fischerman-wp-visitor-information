# fischerman-wp-visitor-information
A Wordpress that displays the visitor data that can be determined via Java Script and "Window Object".
To display the complete data use the following shortcode : [visitor_info].
There is a widget where you can select what you want to display in the widget for visitor information.

The whole code was generated using artificial intelligence and seems to work.

Installation: Place the file " fm-visitor.information.php" in a new directory in the wordpress plugin directory and activate it via GUI.

Use at your own risk, support only if artificial intelligence is involved.
It would be nice if the code would be picked up and extended by a programmer, because I am definitely not a programmer ;-)
